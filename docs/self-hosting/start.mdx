# Build Your Own Lobe Chat

AiPMChat supports various deployment platforms, including Vercel, Docker, and Docker Compose. You can choose a deployment platform that suits you to build your own AiPM Chat.

## Quick Deployment

For users who are new to AiPMChat, we recommend using the client-side database mode for quick deployment. The advantage of this mode is that deployment can be quickly completed with just one command/button, making it easy for you to quickly get started and experience AiPMChat.

You can follow the guide below for quick deployment of AiPMChat:

<PlatformCards urlPrefix={'platform'} />

<Callout>
  In the client-side database mode, data is stored locally on the user's device, without cross-device synchronization, and does not support advanced features such as file uploads and knowledge base.
</Callout>

## Advanced Mode: Server-Side Database

For users who are already familiar with AiPMChat or need cross-device synchronization, you can deploy a version with a server-side database to access a more complete and powerful AiPMChat.
